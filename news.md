                              dCache.org is introducing a new mailing list :<br />

                                 <h8>security at dcache dot org</h8>

                              dCache user should report problems or bugs to this list if there is the suspicion that the issue is security related or if the 
                              report may contain confidential information. (e.g. passwords). Only a very restricted number of people have access to this
                              particular mailing list.

                        <h8>Chimera</h8>
                        <br />
                        Chimera is the preferred name space abstraction for dCache. It is a thin
                        layer on top of a relation database (preferrably PostgreSQL). In contrast
                        to PNFS it is platform independent, scalable, and fully embedded in
                        dCache. By now, most dCache Tier I sites as well as many Tier II sites have
                        migrated to Chimera. PNFS itself is no longer maintained, although
                        dCache does still support using PNFS as a backend. We recommend all
                        sites to upgrade to Chimera as soon as possible.
                        Please study the migration
                        <a href="http://trac.dcache.org/projects/dcache/wiki/pnfsDump2MigratePnfs2Chimera">instructions</a> and give it a try. You can evaluate the 
                        entire migration procedure in a safe test environment.

                  <p>The dCache project uses timeboxing to manage the release process. 
                     A new feature release is made every three months. 
                     These are maintained for four months during which bug fix releases
                     are made. Once a year in spring a long term support release is made - 
                     we call these golden releases. These are maintained for at least
                     two years.
                  </p>
                  <center>
                     <h3>Golden Releases</h3>
                  </center>
		  <p>Currently there are two supported Golden Releases.</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>The latest Golden Release, dCache 2.13 will be supported until end of May 2017.</li>
                    <li>The previous Golden Release, dCache 2.10 will be supported until end of May 2016.</li>
		  </ul>
                  2.16 is anticipated to be the next Golden release, which should be released around 
                  the beginning of June 2016.
