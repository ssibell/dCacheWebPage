__dCache__ is a system for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data,
distributed among a large number of heterogeneous server nodes, under
a single virtual filesystem tree with a variety of standard access
methods. Depending on the Persistency Model, dCache provides methods
for exchanging data with backend (tertiary) Storage Systems as well
as space management, pool attraction, dataset replication, hot spot
determination and recovery from disk or node failures. Connected to
a tertiary storage system, the cache simulates unlimited direct
access storage space. Data exchanges to and from the underlying HSM
are performed automatically and invisibly to the user. Beside HEP
specific protocols, data in dCache can be accessed via __NFSv4.1
(pNFS)__, __FTP__ as well as through __WebDav__.

Getting Started
===============

# Welcome
This aim of this tutorial is to be a comprehensive guide to Jekyll website. We’ll cover topics such as getting your site up and running, creating and managing your content like posts, downloads, documentations and many more. And customizing the way this site works and looks, deploying to various environments, and give you some advice on participating in the future development of Jekyll itself.

# So what is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

# How can I create a new post? 

We will create a post in the _posts folder. As we can see, there are 3 folders in _posts folder. 

If we create a new file in any of the folders, which are categories, with required lines, will published in the main page.
