## NeIC2017 Meeting 

* ETA: Before May 29, 2017


## NeIC2017 
Crossing boundaries — changing the world

Join 200 technical experts, researchers, and decision makers in computing and storage over four days of workshops and conference program.

Building on the enthusiasm from the first two Nordic e-Infrastructure Conferences in 2013 and 2015, we are happy to announce the next NeIC Conference, to be hosted by NeIC and SNIC at the Umeå Folkets Hus.

Similar to the first two NeIC conferences we aim to organise NeIC 2017 as a collaboration between CSC, DeIC, NeIC, NORDUnet, RHnet, SNIC, and UNINETT Sigma2.

Please follow this page for upcoming information about workshops, sessions, invited speakers, and travel to NeIC 2017.
